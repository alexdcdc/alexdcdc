# Hello! 
I'm Alex, a student studying computer science in Georgia Tech's class of 2027. I'm interested in a wide variety of things, ranging from game development to full-stack to graphics and modeling and more. I'm always eager to play with whatever tools/software/ideas catch my eye!

Some fun facts about me:
- I do a bunch of stuff with my free time: fencing, acting, gaming, shower-singing, etc etc.
- My family owns lots of chickens!
- I am 0 attempts for 3 in successfully baking a Japanese cheesecake. ðŸ˜”
